SkepticalCat (SKPCAT) is a fun project that makes fun of the stupid dog coins and tokens while also standing for freedom of thought, skepticism, and free speech. The idea is to have a crypto that is a meme of sorts but that also provides function.
SKPCAT can be traded however people wish. 
SKPCAT can be redeemed for cat meme NFTs (more on that later)
SKPCAT will be mined with SHA256
SKPCAT is for normal people.
